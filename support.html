                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What's included for free?</h3>
                    <p>Every MERIDIAN LABS app includes hundreds of free practice questions (~20% of total content), daily study sessions, Flashcards, and one Practice Test level — no account or payment required.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Do I need to create an account?</h3>
                    <p>No. All MERIDIAN LABS apps work entirely without an account. All your progress is stored locally on your device.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-section">
                <h2>Subscriptions</h2>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What does Pro unlock?</h3>
                    <p>Pro gives you access to the full question bank (1,000–4,200+ questions depending on the app), Smart Review with spaced repetition, Rapid Fire mode, all Practice Test levels, study materials, and the Pass Guarantee.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What subscription plans are available?</h3>
                    <p>We offer Weekly ($4.99/week), Monthly ($8.99/month), and Annual ($34.99/year) plans. All plans include the same features and the Pass Guarantee. Annual saves 67%.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I cancel my subscription?</h3>
                    <p>Subscriptions are managed through your App Store (iPhone) or Google Play (Android) account settings. Open your device's Settings, go to Subscriptions, and cancel from there. You'll keep access through the end of your billing period.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can I get a refund?</h3>
                    <p>Refunds are handled by Apple (App Store) or Google (Google Play) through their standard refund process. Additionally, all Pro plans include our Pass Guarantee — see the <a href="/terms.html#guarantee">Terms of Service</a> for details.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-section">
                <h2>Study Features</h2>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is the daily study session?</h3>
                    <p>Each app includes a daily timed session (50 questions, 30 minutes) that you complete each day to build your study streak. You need 75% accuracy to pass. It builds consistent study habits and test-day time management skills.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How does the confidence system work?</h3>
                    <p>Before answering each question, you indicate whether you feel confident or unsure. This helps the app identify areas where you think you know the material but actually don't — the most dangerous gap for exam day.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is the Exam Ready Certificate?</h3>
                    <p>The Exam Ready Certificate confirms you've demonstrated comprehensive readiness across all exam domains. Earning it qualifies you for the Pass Guarantee.</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-section">
                <h2>Pass Guarantee</h2>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How does the Pass Guarantee work?</h3>
                    <p>If you earn your Exam Ready Certificate, take your exam within 14 days, and don't pass, we'll refund your most recent subscription payment. This applies to all Pro plans across all MERIDIAN LABS apps. See full details in our <a href="/terms.html#guarantee">Terms of Service</a>.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How do I claim the guarantee?</h3>
                    <p>Email <a href="mailto:meridianlabsapps@gmail.com">meridianlabsapps@gmail.com</a> within 30 days of your exam results. Include your purchase receipt, official exam results, and a screenshot of your Exam Ready Certificate with the date earned.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>I lost my progress. Can it be recovered?</h3>
                    <p>All MERIDIAN LABS apps store data locally on your device. If you cleared your browser data or reinstalled the app, progress may be lost. We recommend using the Export feature in Settings regularly to back up your data.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
