            <div class="guarantee-box">
                <h3>Pass Guarantee — Every Pro Plan</h3>
                <p>We're confident our apps will help you pass. That's why we offer to refund your <strong>most recent subscription payment</strong> to any Pro subscriber who meets all eligibility requirements below and still doesn't pass their exam.</p>

                <h3>Eligibility Requirements</h3>
                <p>To qualify for a refund under this guarantee, you must meet <strong>all</strong> of the following at the time of your exam:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Active Pro Subscription:</strong> You must have maintained an active, personally-purchased Pro subscription (Weekly, Monthly, or Annual) for a minimum of 30 consecutive days before your exam date. Subscriptions purchased through third parties, employers, or promotional giveaways are not eligible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exam Ready Certificate:</strong> You must have earned the "Exam Ready" certificate within the app before taking your exam. This certificate requires meeting all readiness criteria tracked by the app, including minimum questions answered, accuracy thresholds, study streak, confidence score, practice test completion, and cleared mistakes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Exam Timing:</strong> You must take your official examination within 14 calendar days after earning your Exam Ready certificate.</li>
                    <li><strong>First Attempt:</strong> This guarantee applies to your first attempt at the examination after earning your certificate. One claim per subscription period.</li>
                    <li><strong>Genuine Preparation:</strong> Your in-app study activity must reflect genuine engagement with the material. This includes completing study sessions across multiple days (not concentrated in a single session), spending reasonable time per question, and demonstrating progressive improvement over your study period.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Required Documentation</h3>
                <p>All of the following must be submitted for your claim to be reviewed:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Official Score Report:</strong> A sharable electronic document or photograph of the official score report issued by the examination's administering organization (e.g., NIC, PTCB, ASVAB/DoD, CompTIA). The report must clearly show your full legal name, the exam name, the exam date, and a failing score or result. Self-reported scores, unofficial transcripts, and screenshots of third-party score-tracking websites are not accepted.</li>
                    <li><strong>Name Verification:</strong> The full legal name on your official score report must match the name associated with your App Store or Google Play purchase receipt.</li>
                    <li><strong>Purchase Receipt:</strong> Your most recent subscription payment receipt from Apple (App Store) or Google (Google Play), showing the date of purchase, amount, and account holder name.</li>
                    <li><strong>In-App Certificate Screenshot:</strong> A screenshot of your Exam Ready certificate screen within the app, showing the certificate code, date earned, and all criteria marked as complete.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Refund Amount</h3>
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> This guarantee covers your <strong>most recent subscription payment only</strong>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Weekly subscribers:</strong> Refund of last weekly payment ($4.99)</li>
                    <li><strong>Monthly subscribers:</strong> Refund of last monthly payment ($8.99)</li>
                    <li><strong>Annual subscribers:</strong> Refund of last annual payment ($34.99)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Previous subscription payments are not refundable under this guarantee. Only your single most recent payment qualifies.</p>

                <h3>How to Claim</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Email <a href="mailto:meridianlabsapps@gmail.com">meridianlabsapps@gmail.com</a> with the subject line "Pass Guarantee Claim — [App Name]" within 30 days of receiving your official exam results.</li>
                    <li>Attach all four required documents listed above.</li>
                    <li>We will verify your eligibility by cross-referencing your submitted documents against our internal records of your in-app study activity, certificate status, and subscription history.</li>
                    <li>You will receive a decision within 14 business days of submitting a complete claim. Incomplete claims will be returned for additional documentation.</li>
                    <li>Approved refunds will be processed within 30 business days of approval.</li>
                </ol>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> By accepting a refund under this guarantee, your subscription will be canceled and you will lose access to premium features.</p>

                <h3>Verification and Fraud Prevention</h3>
                <p>MERIDIAN LABS reserves the right to verify all claims using internal app data, including but not limited to: total questions answered, accuracy trends, time spent per question, number of distinct study sessions, days active, and certificate issuance records. We may also verify the authenticity of submitted score reports by checking document metadata, formatting consistency, and alignment with known examination schedules.</p>
                <p>MERIDIAN LABS reserves the right to deny any claim where evidence suggests the guarantee is being used in bad faith, including but not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Study requirements completed in an unusually short timeframe or through patterns suggesting automated or inattentive use of the application</li>
                    <li>Exam scores that are dramatically lower than in-app performance, suggesting the exam was taken without genuine effort</li>
                    <li>Submitted documents that show signs of alteration, fabrication, or inconsistency</li>
                    <li>Claims where the claimant has already received a refund through Apple, Google, or a chargeback for the same subscription payment</li>
                    <li>Attempts to submit multiple claims across different subscription periods or accounts</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What's Not Covered</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Previous subscription payments (only the most recent payment is refundable)</li>
                    <li>Practical, hands-on, or clinical examination portions</li>
                    <li>Exams taken more than 14 days after earning the Exam Ready certificate</li>

                    <li>Subscriptions purchased through third parties, employers, or promotional offers</li>
                    <li>Claims where a refund or chargeback has already been obtained for the same payment through any other channel</li>
                </ul>
